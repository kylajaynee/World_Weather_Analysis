# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6 
Use weather description data to enhance the PlanMyTrip app. The beta testers will use input statements to filter the data for weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Geoapify Routing API, a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer will be created.
